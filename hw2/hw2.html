            <p>I found this comic strip (pictured left) to be a very interesting take on the notion of comics. I haven't researched which form of media came first, comics, or film, but they both essentially achieve a similar purpose; tell a story associated with images (maybe the same could be said for memes).</p>
            <p>What makes this excerpt super effective as a persuasive mode to achieve this point is that the comic sequence is stylized as a film strip. This gives the viewer a visual representation. </p>
            <p>This comparison, however, got me thinking about modern forms of comics. Memes achieve an extremely similar style of comics (text with deliberately associated images), however they are ripe for the modern age of digital communication. </p>
            <p>Memes, like comics, can tell a story with these things. Look below, for example, at this meme:</p>
            <div class="center-img-wrapper"><img src="letthatsinkin.jiff" id="sink-img"></div>
            <p>It has a similar form of a comic (text and associated image), it makes you chuckle (depending on if you're not a person who cringes at silly puns), and also provides a sort of commentary on the English language.</p>
            <p>From <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/comic">the etimology</a> of the word "comic", associated with <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/comedy?ref=etymonline_crossreference">comedy</a>, the word means "a narrative with a happy ending; any composition intended for amusement". This meme fits the guise of "intended for amusement", while also staying true to Scott McCloud's definition:</p>
            <div class="center-img-wrapper"><img src="comic_def.png"></div>
            <p>This meme also succeeds in being a "juxtaposition of pictoral and other images in deliberate sequence". While also conveying information. The information it conveys, on a subsurface level, is about how odd the english language is. English speakers would understand "let that sink in" in the context of pondering a thought and having an idea materialize in your brain. However, if you literally looked at the words and visually depicted what they said, you would get an image similar to the meme.</p>
