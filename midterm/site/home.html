        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Are you tired of paying a monthly subscription for Adobe Creative Software? Are you simply a hobbyist who enjoys digital image manipulation but can't justify spending $50 a month to have temporary access to creative software? Have you tried GIMP and while you love the open source initiatives behind GIMP, it simply doesn't cut it as an image compositor? Have you also tried Inkscape for vector image creation, but aren't pleased with that either? Look no further:</p>
        <h2>Introducing the Affinity Software Suite</h2>

                    Affinity Photo is a photo compositor. It can replace your Photoshop workflow for the low price of a one time payment of $50.
