                <h2>The Importance of Privacy</h2>
                <p>The most interesting quote to me from the article <a href="http://oldobjectsnewideas.com/_reading/Berners-Lee_LongLiveWeb2010.pdf"><i>Long Live the Web</i></a> is the paragraph about ISP snooping on network traffic;</p>
                <p>"Other threats to the web result from meddling with the Inter-net, including snooping. In 2008 one company, Phorm, devised a way for an ISP to peek inside the packets of information it was sending. The ISP could determine every URI that any customer was browsing. The ISP could then create a profile of the sites the user went to in order to produce targeted advertising."</p>
                <p>This information, in the wrong hands, is extremely dangerous to the continuation of a free world. Not only do ISPs do this, Google and Facebook do this. What exists currently is a method for these companies to develop a psychological profile about your interests and your personality, based off how you interact with the internet. "Oh you clicked x article, stayed on it for 30 seconds, and then viewed y article which oppposes x and stayed there for 15 minutes, you must be a supporter of y beliefs" (As a rudimentary example). This information may be okay in the hands of the all benevolent government of the country which you reside, however if you live in a tyrannical regime, you may not like if your government has this information.</p>
                <p>This might seem like a crazy idea to you, living a free country, but why don't you ask how this turned out for the Uighar Muslims living in China. China essentially is rounding people up and putting them in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/a-spreadsheet-of-those-in-hell-how-china-corralled-uighurs-into-concentration-camps/2020/02/28/4daeca4a-58c8-11ea-ab68-101ecfec2532_story.html">concentration camps</a> due to their religious beliefs. Methodologies of doing this include obvious things, like taking people from their places of worship, but other, more oppressive ways of doing this include <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51520622">tracking which websites people visit, assessing their affiliation with said information, and rounding them up after the results.</a> This type of behavior on China's part is not only a crime against humanity, but it is a threat to the idea of a free internet, and a free world.</p>
                <p>This information being tracked might not lead to concentration camps in the US today, but having the data exist in some way allows a potential future regime to use this data for malicious purposes.</p>
                <p>If you want to combat some of these things, switch to Firefox and DuckDuckGo, I've described these in more depth on my <a href="/">homepage.</a></p>
