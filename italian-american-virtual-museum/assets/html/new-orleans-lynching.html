                    <h1>October 15, 1890</h1>
                    <p>On the evening of October 15, 1890, New Orleans police chief David Hennessy was shot by several gunmen as he walked home from work. Hennessy returned fire and chased his attackers before collapsing. When asked who had shot him, Hennessy reportedly whispered to Captain William O'Connor, "Dagoes" (a derogatory term for Italians and others of Mediterranean heritage). Hennessy was awake in the hospital for several hours after the shooting, and spoke to friends, but did not name the shooters. The next day complications set in and he died <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_14,_1891_New_Orleans_lynchings#Assassination_of_David_Hennessy">(wiki)</a></p>

                    <h1>After the Assassination</h1>
                    <p>The Mayor of New Orleans, Joseph A. Shakespeare, told the police to "scour the whole neighborhood. Arrest every Italian you come across." By some accounts, as many as 250 Italians were rounded up. Most were eventually released for lack of evidence. Local Italians were afraid to leave their homes for several days after the murder, but eventually the furor died down and they returned to work.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, 19 men were charged with murder or accessory and held without bail.</p>
                    <h3>Charles Mantranga</h3>
                    <p>Charged with plotting the murder, and several of the Mantranga's friends and workers</p>
                    <h3>Pietro Monasterio</h3>
                    <p>A shoemaker, arrested because he lived across the street from the shooting</p>
                    <h3>Antonio Marchesi</h3>
                    <p>A fruit peddler, arrested because he was "a friend of Monasterio's"</p>
                    <h3>Emmanuele Polizzi</h3>
                    <p>He was identified by a policeman as someone fleeing the scene</p>

                    <h1>The Trial</h1>
                    <p>The succeeding trial lasted almost a month and the final verdict was that the suspects were <b>not guilty</b>. There were numerous issues with the evidence, including unreliable witnesses, and two men, Mastranga and Bastian Incardono had zero charges brought against them. The Jurors left the trial, feeling they did what was right, however the people of New Orleans were not happy with this verdict.</p>

                    <p>After the verdict came that the men were innocent, the mob was unhappy with this result. They subsequently charged the prison and assassinated 11 of the men.</p>
                    <p>The mentally ill Polizzi was hauled outside, hanged from a lamppost, and shot. Antonio Bagnetto, a fruit peddler, was hanged from a tree and shot. Nine others were shot or clubbed to death inside the prison. The bullet-riddled bodies of Polizzi and Bagnetto were left hanging for hours.</p>

                    <h1>Aftermath</h1>
                    <p>The aftermath of this event saw the news take the side of the lynch mob - against the innocent Italians. A headline from the New York Times read: <a href="https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D03E1D81239E033A25756C1A9659C94609ED7CF">Chief Hennessy Avenged; Eleven of His Italian Assassins Lynched by a Mob. An Uprising of Indignant Citizens in New Orleans â€“ The Prison Doors Forced and the Italian Murderers Shot Down"</a></p>
                    <h2>Italy's Response</h2>
                    <p>As a result of what happened Italian consul Pasquale Corte left New Orleans at the direction of the government in Italy. Subsequently, the United States pulled its diplomats from Rome. For about a year, there were talks of Italy declaring war on the United States</p>

                    <h1>Remediation</h1>
                    <p>Following these rising political tensions, in an effort to maintain diplomatic peace, then President, Benjamin Harrison sought to make ammends to the Italian-American community.</p>
                        
                    <p>The year was 1892 - the 400 year anniversary of Christopher Columbus' voyage to the New World. Columbus, being born in Genoa, Italy, was the perfect idol for Benjamin Harrison to recognize the Italian-American community.
                        
                    <p>He declared October 12, 1892 to be the first nationwide celebration of Columbus day. Statues to Columbus were also planned around the country, including the statue at Columbus Circle in New York City. The recognization of Columbus Day, and the statues to Columbus legitimized Italian-Americans' place as contributing members of society, and served as a reminder of what happened in New Orleans.</p>
