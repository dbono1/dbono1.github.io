            <h1>December 12, 1915</h1>
            <h4>Hoboken, NJ</h4>
            <p>Frank Sinatra was born in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey, the only child of Italian immigrants Natalina "Dolly" Garaventa and Antonino Martino "Marty" Sinatra. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his eardrumâ€”damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he suffered from cystic acne that further scarred his face and neck. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra#Early_life">(wiki)</a>

            <h1>Sinatramania</h1>
            <p>By May 1941, Sinatra topped the male singer polls in Billboard and DownBeat magazines.His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls of that time were called, revealed a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time. The phenomenon became officially known as "Sinatramania" after his "legendary opening" at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion ... All this for a fellow I never heard of. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra#Onset_of_Sinatramania_and_role_in_World_War_II_(1942%E2%80%931945)">(wiki)</a></p>

                <h1>New York, New York</h1>
                <p>Despite Being Born in Hoboken, one of Sinatra's debatably most influential song is about New York. The song is the theme song from the Martin Scorsese film New York, New York (1977), composed by John Kander, with lyrics by Fred Ebb. It was written for and performed in the film by Liza Minnelli. In 1980, Sinatra recorded it for his album, "Trilogy: Past Present Future", and his recording has become one of the most iconic symbols of Sinatra, and New York City.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_from_New_York,_New_York">wiki</a></p>

            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today<br>
                I want to be a part of it: New York, New York<br>
                These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray<br>
                Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York
                <br>
                I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep <br>
                And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap<br>
                <br>
                These little town blues, are melting away <br>
                I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York <br>
                <br>
                If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere<br>
                It's up to you, New York, New York<br>
                <br>
                New York, New York<br>
                I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps<br>
                And find I'm a number one, top of the list<br>
                King of the hill, a number one<br>
                <br>
                These little town blues, oh, are melting away<br>
                I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York<br>
                And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere<br>
                It's up to you, New York, New York<br>
            </p>
