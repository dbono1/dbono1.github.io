            <h1>December 12, 1915</h1>
            <h4>Hoboken, NJ</h4>
            <p>Frank Sinatra was born in an upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken, New Jersey, the only child of Italian immigrants Natalina "Dolly" Garaventa and Antonino Martino "Marty" Sinatra. Sinatra weighed 13.5 pounds (6.1 kg) at birth and had to be delivered with the aid of forceps, which caused severe scarring to his left cheek, neck, and ear, and perforated his eardrum—damage that remained for life. Due to his injuries at birth, his baptism at St. Francis Church in Hoboken was delayed until April 2, 1916. A childhood operation on his mastoid bone left major scarring on his neck, and during adolescence he suffered from cystic acne that further scarred his face and neck. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra#Early_life">(wiki)</a>

            <h1>Sinatramania</h1>
            <p>By May 1941, Sinatra topped the male singer polls in Billboard and DownBeat magazines.His appeal to bobby soxers, as teenage girls of that time were called, revealed a whole new audience for popular music, which had been recorded mainly for adults up to that time. The phenomenon became officially known as "Sinatramania" after his "legendary opening" at the Paramount Theatre in New York on December 30, 1942. According to Nancy Sinatra, Jack Benny later said, "I thought the goddamned building was going to cave in. I never heard such a commotion ... All this for a fellow I never heard of. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra#Onset_of_Sinatramania_and_role_in_World_War_II_(1942%E2%80%931945)">(wiki)</a></p>

                <h1>New York, New York</h1>
                <p>Despite Being Born in Hoboken, one of Sinatra's debatably most influential song is about New York. The song is the theme song from the Martin Scorsese film New York, New York (1977), composed by John Kander, with lyrics by Fred Ebb. It was written for and performed in the film by Liza Minnelli. In 1980, Sinatra recorded it for his album, "Trilogy: Past Present Future", and his recording has become one of the most iconic symbols of Sinatra, and New York City. This song is still played, to this day, at Yankee Stadium!<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_from_New_York,_New_York">wiki</a></p>

            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today<br>
                I want to be a part of it: New York, New York<br>
                These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray<br>
                Right through the very heart of it: New York, New York
                <br>
                I wanna wake up in a city that doesn't sleep <br>
                And find I'm king of the hill, top of the heap<br>
                <br>
                These little town blues, are melting away <br>
                I'll make a brand new start of it in old New York <br>
                <br>
                If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere<br>
                It's up to you, New York, New York<br>
                <br>
                New York, New York<br>
                I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps<br>
                And find I'm a number one, top of the list<br>
                King of the hill, a number one<br>
                <br>
                These little town blues, oh, are melting away<br>
                I'm gonna make a brand new start of it in old New York<br>
                And if I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere<br>
                It's up to you, New York, New York<br>

            <p>The song you're listening to right now. It was written for Tony Bennet in 1959. Sinatra recorded it on June 9th, 1964, and released in August of the same year. This song was played as a wake-up call for the crew of the Apollo 10 mission (the one before we landed on the moon).</p>

            <p>
                Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum<br>
                You came along and everything's startin' to hum<br>
                Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come<br>
                <br>
                Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?<br>
                You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine<br>
                <br>
                A-Wait till the warm-up's underway<br>
                Wait till our lips have met<br>
                And wait till you see that sunshine day<br>
                You ain't seen nothin' yet<br>
                <br>
                The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?<br>
                Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine<br>
                <br>
                Come the day you're mine<br>
                I'm gonna teach you to fly<br>
                We've only tasted the wine<br>
                We're gonna drain the cup dry<br>
                <br>
                Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround<br>
                You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground<br>
                <br>
                A-Wait till you're locked in my embrace<br>
                Wait till I draw you near<br>
                A-Wait till you see that sunshine place<br>
                Ain't nothin' like it here<br>
                <br>
                The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?<br>
                The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine<br>
                <br>
                Come the day you're mine<br>

            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say<br>
                You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May<br>
                But I know I'm gonna change that tune<br>
                When I'm back on top, back on top in June<br>
                <br>
                I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem<br>
                Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream<br>
                But I don't let it, let it get me down<br>
                'cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around<br>
                <br>
                I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king<br>
                I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing<br>
                Each time I find myself flat on my face<br>
                I pick myself up and get back in the race<br>
                <br>
                That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it<br>
                I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it<br>
                And if I didn't think it was worth one single try<br>
                I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly<br>
                <br>
                I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king<br>
                I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing<br>
                Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face<br>
                I just pick myself up and get back in the race<br>
                <br>
                That's life (that's life), that's life and I can't deny it<br>
                Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it<br>
                But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July<br>
                I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball a-and die<br>
                <br>
                My, my!<br>
